# Battlecon

A leaderboard for battlecon leagues. Organize the members of your league, record plays, view character matchups, and share strategy advice.

## TODO list

* Add support for multiple leagues. You need to be able to switch active league, when logged in; create or join a league, when registering; and join more leagues when logged in.
* A standardized way of namespacing the url to the league.
* More stats for players, and for characters.
* The ability to add posts to a character, or to a matchup, or to a players.
* League overview page. Also player matchup table page.
* Administering leagues? (Anyone can record games, or only league owner)
